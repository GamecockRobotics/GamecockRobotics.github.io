    The Push Bot was the first robot created by team EZPZ. The robot was built with limited parts,
    and had very limited functionality. Using borrowed parts, this robot had a 4 motor chassis and 
    a single motor on a simple lever arm. This arm was  capable of flinging a single preloaded ring
    onto a mobile goal and also lifting and moving a mobile goal. Though not incredibly complex, it
    was capable of using a lifted mobile goal to push down the tilting platform and climbing up to
    balance at the end of the match. The Push Bot was only used at the team's first competition,
    Tigertown Throwdown, at Clemson University. Through a well practiced autonomous and excellent
    driving, the team was able to beat Clemson's team at their own competition.

  name: "Big Chungus and Lil' Sexy"
  description: >-
    Big Chungus and Lil' Sexy were the first robots designed and built by the team without the
    constraint of limited parts, however, Big Chungus was constructed completely from steel. Both
    robots had a similar design with a treaded ring intake to place rings on the alliance mobile
    goals held in the back of the robot. The back of these robots had a tilting mechanism that 
    would clamp and tilt back the mobile goals. Though they both had similar designs, their 
    implementation was very different. Lil' Sexy used a pneumatic piston to pull back the tilting 
    mechanism. Conversely, Big Chungus used a pulley and rope system to pull back the tilting 
    mechanism. Both robots also used four bars to lift the mobile goals onto the platform. Lil' 
    Sexy used a piston with a locking claw to prevent other robots from stealing the mobile goal 
    out of its grasp. Big Chungus used a motorized claw grip to pick up the mobile goals. </p>
    
    <p>Big Chungus and Lil' Sexy were used in back to back Competitions in West Virginia and 
    Salisbury, Maryland. Neither of these robots had practice on a field before the West Virginia. 
    Throughout these competitions, with extensive practice, both the drive team and the Autonomous 
    improved drastically. Big Chungus, though not as fast as other robots, went for the middle 
    mobile goal first during autonomous. It would then return and grab an alliance goal and place 
    rings on the goal to get the autonomous win point. Meanwhile, Lil' Sexy would quickly charge 
    towards one of the neutral goals then return to place a ring on the other alliance goal for the 
    autonomous win point. Because of the steel, it made it difficult for other robots to match the 
    robots strength and pull the goals to the other side. This also made it difficult to park, 
    however, with a push from Lil' Sexy, both bots were able to dual park with up to 4 mobile 
    goals. The crowning achievment of these bots was winning the excellence award at the Salisbury 
    Maryland competition.
